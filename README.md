# Global Entry Interview Time Slot Bot

A Python script that notifies you via text if an available Global Entry interview time slot becomes available on the TTP scheduler. Currently the wait times for many airports are months out. This script checks the TTP scheduler every 5 seconds in the event that someone reschedules or cancels.
